LC-3 Simulator

Basic Component:
* Memory
* ALU
* Clock
* Control Signal

How to implement?
* Take full adventage of class
* Construct standard parts first
* Use interface similar to data path sheet


Dev Note 1:
I have implement a bunch of "basic ideas" of LC3 architecture. But I haven't fully used the basic property of Python's OOP yet.
I will try to implement the idea of "buffer", "bus" and "clock" next time
